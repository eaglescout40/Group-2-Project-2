Instructions: 
* One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.
* Protect the repo's master branch as we did during project 1.
  * Once at the repo's page, click the "Settings" tab.
  * Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.
  * Under "Branch protection rules", choose "master" from the dropdown.
  * Check off the following options:
    * "Protect this branch"
    * "Require pull request reviews before merging"
    * "Include administrators"
    * "Require status checks to pass before merging"
    * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
  
  * Click "Save changes"
* Once complete, invite the other group members as collaborators.
* Upon creation of your repository, we would like you and your group to then create a Heroku application and connect your GitHub Repository for automatic deployment.
  * We have created a written guide and video guide on how you can link your GitHub Repo to your Heroku Application for continuous deployment which your instructor will provide.
* Once connection is complete, link your Heroku Applications live link to your TAs.
